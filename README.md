# Surface Laptop 13 Linux

Linux support for the Surface Laptop for Business 13" (1st edition,
Snapdragon X1P42100), built by testing on real hardware. Everything here is
distro-neutral: kernel config and patches, device tree, firmware lists,
initramfs hooks, and the inputs needed to assemble a bootable UKI.

There is no root filesystem, desktop, or disk image in this repository. Your
distribution provides those; this repo provides the hardware-specific parts.


## What works

Tested on the actual machine:

- Boot via UKI (systemd-boot) from external USB storage
- Both USB-C ports in host mode (SSD, hub, display adapter)
- Wi-Fi 7 (Qualcomm WCN7850 over PCIe, with the required early firmware)
- Bluetooth (WCN7850 over UART)
- Touchscreen (HID-over-I2C, `1FD2:4001`)
- Fingerprint reader in the power button (`04f3:0c9e`): enrollment and
  matching work through fprintd with a small libfprint patch

Known limitations: suspend reboots instead of resuming, the internal speaker
works but the 3.5mm jack needs more DT work before it is safe to enable, and
the internal microphone has never worked.


## Building

You need a kernel checkout and an AArch64 cross compiler. Then:

```sh
./build.sh check      # verify inputs exist
./build.sh dtb        # device trees (works standalone)
./build.sh kernel
./build.sh initramfs
./build.sh uki
./build.sh package
./build.sh verify
```

`Containerfile` builds the same thing in Docker/Podman if you prefer a
container. The kernel build is the slow part; everything else takes seconds.


## Boot files

The build produces three UKIs from one kernel:

- `surface-laptop-13-current.efi` - USB-C host + touchscreen, the baseline
- `surface-laptop-13-bluetooth.efi` - same + WCN7850 UART node and early BT
  modules/firmware in the initramfs; the Wi-Fi firmware is included in both
  initramfs variants when `WCN7850_FIRMWARE_SOURCE` is supplied
- `surface-laptop-13-fingerprint.efi` - bluetooth baseline + internal USB host
  for the fingerprint reader

Kernel version string: `7.2.0-rc5-surface-laptop-13`.


## KVM / EL2 boot

The Snapdragon X firmware normally enters Linux in EL1, so enabling
`CONFIG_KVM` alone is not sufficient. The KVM path uses the checked-in X1 EL2
overlay, a separate GRUB entry, and a Secure Launch EFI image built by
`tools/build-surface-kvm-efi.sh`. The supplied Microsoft `tcblaunch.exe` is
required by that Secure Launch step; Secure Boot must be disabled unless the
custom launcher is signed.

The normal firmware path must remain the original Proxmox shim. Only the
explicit EL2/KVM GRUB entry may chainload `surface-kvm-entry.efi`; putting the
Secure Launch launcher in the default `BOOTAA64.EFI` path causes the hook to be
installed twice and can hang at `Loading initial ramdisk`.

For this X1P42100 firmware, use the validated Windows 11 ARM64 24H2
`tcblaunch.exe` build 10.0.26100.1742 (887432 bytes,
SHA-256 `5dfcd0253b6ee99499ab33cac221e8a9cea47f3fdf6d4e11de9a9f3c4770d03d`).
The builder rejects other TCBs by default because several newer builds remove
the error-return path and can hang or reset this machine. Other Qualcomm
platforms may opt in explicitly with `--allow-untested-tcb`.

On X1P42100, upstream slbounce's global cache sweep can reset the machine inside
`ExitBootServices`, before Secure Launch authentication. Passing
`--slbounce-source` builds a private source copy with
`tools/slbounce-x1p42100-safe-ebs.patch`; it also fixes the unsafe handling of an
`EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` memory-map response. The EL2 entries retain
`clk_ignore_unused pd_ignore_unused` so Linux does not turn off resources still
owned by the platform firmware, `console=tty0 usbcore.autosuspend=-1` for
reliable console and USB-root boot, and `id_aa64mmfr0.ecv=1`, which is required
before starting KVM guests on X1P42100. Omitting the clock/power-domain
arguments can reset the machine before the first userspace message.

Build the EFI launcher from a normal Proxmox EFI image and add the optional
EL2 entry to a patched installer ISO as follows:

```sh
export KERNEL_SOURCE=/root/linux
export KERNEL_APPLY_PATCHES=1
export SURFACE_OUTPUT_DIR=build
export SURFACE_WORK_DIR=build/.work
./build.sh kernel
./build.sh dtb

./tools/build-surface-kvm-efi.sh \
  --base-efi build/surface-normal-efi.img \
  --output build/surface-kvm-efi.img \
  --tcb /path/to/tcblaunch-10.0.26100.1742.exe \
  --slbounce-source /path/to/slbounce \
  --el2-dtb build/.work/dtb/surface-laptop-13-el2.dtb

GRUB_MODULE_DIR=/usr/lib/grub/arm64-efi \
./build-proxmox-iso.sh \
  --iso proxmox-ve_9.2-1-arm64.iso \
  --output build/proxmox-ve_9.2-1-arm64-surface-kvm.iso \
  --kernel-image build/.work/kernel/Image \
  --dtb build/.work/dtb/surface-laptop-13-current.dtb \
  --el2-dtb build/.work/dtb/surface-laptop-13-el2.dtb \
  --efi-image build/surface-kvm-efi.img
```

`--qebspil`/`--qebspil-source` can package the optional Qualcomm DSP pre-boot
loader, and `--firmware-tree` copies an additional firmware tree into the EFI
image. It is not started by default: use `--load-qebspil` only after validating
the basic EL2 path on the target device. The normal EL1 DTB remains separate so non-KVM boots and hardware
variants can continue to use their own menu entries. The ISO KVM entries
chainload a Secure Launch bridge on the ISO filesystem, then boot the selected
EL2 DTB and installer initramfs; they do not rely on a writable GRUB
environment. The builder keeps that KVM payload only on the ISO9660 volume;
the embedded FAT image retains the normal PVE shim/GRUB path. This is
intentional because the EFI launcher rejects ambiguous volumes when both the
ISO and the El Torito FAT image contain a complete KVM payload.
The embedded FAT GRUB configuration is rewritten to find `/boot/linux26`
instead of retaining the source ISO's filesystem UUID, so firmware cannot
fall through to an installed PVE disk after the ISO is rebuilt.
`build-proxmox-iso.sh` accepts `EL2_KERNEL_ARGS` when a different Qualcomm
firmware needs a platform-specific EL2 command line.

For firmware which does not reliably expose the ISO9660 filesystem to GRUB,
pass `--fat-boot`. This creates a 256 MiB El Torito FAT image containing the
kernel, installer initramfs, both DTBs, and the complete Secure Launch chain.
The normal Proxmox shim and GRUB binaries are retained, while the FAT GRUB menu
loads every boot file relative to the USB device from which it was started; it
performs no internal-disk, partition, label, UUID, or marker search. Its KVM
entry follows the installed Surface sequence (`surface-kvm-entry.efi`,
slbounce, then the standalone KVM GRUB), and saves a Ready entry on the USB
FAT environment as the one-shot fallback. The menu keeps both KVM and PVE
Ready installer entries, with KVM selected by default on the first USB boot.
The builder also verifies that the selected initramfs contains the Proxmox ISO
`.cd-info` and installer `init`; a generic Debian initramfs is rejected because
it drops to BusyBox with `No root device specified` when used without a root= argument.
Before rebuilding the ISO, it patches the Proxmox installer `init` to preload
the Surface kernel's `dm_mod`, bio-prison, bufio, persistent-data, and thin-pool
modules through `/sbin/modprobe`. The build fails if that loader, any required
module, or the LVM userspace tool is absent, preventing an installer from
reaching `lvcreate` without a working device-mapper stack.

For an installed system, use `tools/installed-grub-surface-laptop-13` as the
custom `/etc/grub.d/01_surface-laptop-13`. It arms `surface-el1-ready` before
the Secure Launch handoff, so an early reset falls back to Ready. Install
`tools/surface-kvm-clear-fallback.sh` and its systemd unit as well; a successful
EL2 boot clears the one-shot fallback after networking is up.


## Using on your own install

1. Build or reuse a kernel from `kernel/config/base.config` (source revision
   locked in `kernel/source.lock`).
2. Take your distro initramfs, add the early-firmware hook from
   `initramfs/scripts/` if you boot from USB-C storage.
3. Point the kernel cmdline at your root (`LABEL=`, `UUID=`, whatever your
   distro uses).
4. Assemble the UKI, check its sections/hashes, copy it to the ESP.

If booting from USB, make sure `uas` loads before root mount - build it in or
add it to initramfs modules.

Both USB-C controllers run fixed host mode (no role switching). The Bluetooth
overlay adds a `qcom,wcn7850-bt` serdev child on GENI UART `a98000` plus its
enable GPIO/regulators; touchscreen sits on I2C at `a80000`, address `0x34`,
HID descriptor register 0 (from Windows ACPI).


## Checking it works

After boot, useful commands:

```sh
bluetoothctl list          # should show a controller
rfkill list                # nothing hard-blocked
lsusb                      # 04f3:3317 keyboard/touchpad, 04f3:0c9e fingerprint
cat /proc/asound/cards     # sound card present
dmesg | grep -Ei 'dwc3|xhci|wcn7850|i2c_hid'
```

Fingerprint userspace setup (libfprint patch, fprintd) is documented in
`docs/fingerprint-userspace.md`.
