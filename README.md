# Surface Laptop 13 Linux

Linux support for the Surface Laptop for Business 13" (1st edition,
Snapdragon X1P42100), built by testing on real hardware. Everything here is
distro-neutral: kernel config and patches, device tree, firmware lists,
initramfs hooks, and the inputs needed to assemble a bootable UKI.

There is no root filesystem, desktop, or disk image in this repository. Your
distribution provides those; this repo provides the hardware-specific parts.


## What works

Tested on the actual machine:

- Boot via UKI (systemd-boot) from external USB storage
- Both USB-C ports in host mode (SSD, hub, display adapter)
- Bluetooth (WCN7850 over UART)
- Touchscreen (HID-over-I2C, `1FD2:4001`)
- Fingerprint reader in the power button (`04f3:0c9e`): enrollment and
  matching work through fprintd with a small libfprint patch

Known limitations: suspend reboots instead of resuming, the internal speaker
works but the 3.5mm jack needs more DT work before it is safe to enable, and
the internal microphone has never worked.


## Building

You need a kernel checkout and an AArch64 cross compiler. Then:

```sh
./build.sh check      # verify inputs exist
./build.sh dtb        # device trees (works standalone)
./build.sh kernel
./build.sh initramfs
./build.sh uki
./build.sh package
./build.sh verify
```

`Containerfile` builds the same thing in Docker/Podman if you prefer a
container. The kernel build is the slow part; everything else takes seconds.


## Boot files

The build produces three UKIs from one kernel:

- `surface-laptop-13-current.efi` - USB-C host + touchscreen, the baseline
- `surface-laptop-13-bluetooth.efi` - same + WCN7850 UART node and early BT
  modules/firmware in the initramfs
- `surface-laptop-13-fingerprint.efi` - bluetooth baseline + internal USB host
  for the fingerprint reader

Kernel version string: `7.2.0-rc5-surface-laptop-13`.


## Using on your own install

1. Build or reuse a kernel from `kernel/config/base.config` (source revision
   locked in `kernel/source.lock`).
2. Take your distro initramfs, add the early-firmware hook from
   `initramfs/scripts/` if you boot from USB-C storage.
3. Point the kernel cmdline at your root (`LABEL=`, `UUID=`, whatever your
   distro uses).
4. Assemble the UKI, check its sections/hashes, copy it to the ESP.

If booting from USB, make sure `uas` loads before root mount - build it in or
add it to initramfs modules.

Both USB-C controllers run fixed host mode (no role switching). The Bluetooth
overlay adds a `qcom,wcn7850-bt` serdev child on GENI UART `a98000` plus its
enable GPIO/regulators; touchscreen sits on I2C at `a80000`, address `0x34`,
HID descriptor register 0 (from Windows ACPI).


## Checking it works

After boot, useful commands:

```sh
bluetoothctl list          # should show a controller
rfkill list                # nothing hard-blocked
lsusb                      # 04f3:3317 keyboard/touchpad, 04f3:0c9e fingerprint
cat /proc/asound/cards     # sound card present
dmesg | grep -Ei 'dwc3|xhci|wcn7850|i2c_hid'
```

Fingerprint userspace setup (libfprint patch, fprintd) is documented in
`docs/fingerprint-userspace.md`.
