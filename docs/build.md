# Build model

The public build has four independent inputs:

| Input | Source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kernel | Linux source plus the neutral config | `Image`, modules, release |
| Device tree | measured Type-C DTB when supplied, otherwise the checked-in DTS, plus touchscreen/Bluetooth/fingerprint overlays | touchscreen, touchscreen+Bluetooth, and experimental fingerprint DTBs |
| Initramfs | OS-provided initramfs plus early Surface hooks | boot initramfs |
| UKI metadata | neutral `os-release` and caller cmdline | EFI UKI |

`build.sh package` runs these stages and writes a local recovery set. It never
creates a partition table, mounts an ESP, writes a block device, builds a root
filesystem, or starts a package manager.

The kernel build uses the `aarch64-linux-gnu-` compiler prefix by default. On
an AArch64 host, set `KERNEL_CROSS_COMPILE=` to use the native compiler.

The command line contains `root=UUID=CHANGE-ME` as a safe placeholder. A
distribution integration must replace it with the UUID or label of its own
root filesystem before deployment.

Set `KERNEL_SOURCE`, `KERNEL_CONFIG`, `KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT`, `BASE_DTS`,
`BASE_DTB_INPUT`, `INITRD_BASE`, `FIRMWARE_SOURCE`,
`WCN7850_FIRMWARE_SOURCE`, and `UKI_STUB` to port the builder to another host.
`UKIFY` can point to a non-standard `ukify` executable;
the builder also detects the Debian paths `/usr/lib/systemd/ukify` and
`/lib/systemd/ukify`.

The measured base DTB is not tracked in this source-only repository. If
`BASE_DTB_INPUT` is absent, the builder compiles `BASE_DTS` automatically;
`REBUILD_BASE_DTB=1` forces that source rebuild even when a measured DTB is
available.

`KERNEL_SOURCE`, `INITRD_BASE`, `FIRMWARE_SOURCE`, and
`WCN7850_FIRMWARE_SOURCE` have no default: the
full kernel/UKI build fails fast when they are not exported. The DTB-only
target does not require them and can be run independently with
`./build.sh dtb`. Example for an Ubuntu host that already installed its own
arm64 kernel packages:

```sh
export KERNEL_SOURCE=$HOME/src/linux
export KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT=$PWD/kernel/config/desktop.config
export INITRD_BASE=/boot/initrd.img-7.2.0-rc5-surface-laptop-13
export FIRMWARE_SOURCE=$HOME/firmware/qca-bluetooth
export WCN7850_FIRMWARE_SOURCE=/lib/firmware/ath12k/WCN7850/hw2.0
./build.sh uki
```

The generated module tree contains the optional CIFS and WireGuard modules in
addition to the Surface drivers. Install that module tree into the target OS
with the distribution's normal module-packaging tools. Only modules needed
before root discovery belong in the initramfs; CIFS and WireGuard can remain in
the installed module tree for ordinary post-boot use.

## Patching a Proxmox VE ARM64 ISO

When `proxmox-ve_9.2-1-arm64.iso` is in the repository root, the dedicated
wrapper builds the Surface ARM64 kernel, builds the current Surface DTB, adds
the matching kernel modules to the Proxmox installer initramfs, and writes a
new bootable ISO under `build/`:

```sh
apt-get install -y xorriso p7zip-full zstd cpio
./build-proxmox-iso.sh
```

The default output is
`build/proxmox-ve_9.2-1-arm64-surface.iso`. Use `--iso FILE`, `--output FILE`,
`--kernel-image FILE`, `--dtb FILE`, or `--wcn7850-firmware DIR` to override
individual inputs. Pass the target's
`/lib/firmware/ath12k/WCN7850/hw2.0` directory with the latter option so the
installer initramfs can bring up Wi-Fi before the installed system is mounted.
The result contains an unsigned development kernel, so Secure Boot must be
disabled or the kernel must be signed before booting it.

To make Wi-Fi available through `nmcli` both in the live installer and after
installation, pass an external directory containing the ARM64 Debian package
set. The packages are copied into the ISO and installed by the normal Proxmox
package phase; they are not tracked in Git:

```sh
./build-proxmox-iso.sh \
  --wcn7850-firmware /lib/firmware/ath12k/WCN7850/hw2.0 \
  --network-manager-packages /path/to/arm64-network-manager-debs
```

The package directory must include `network-manager`, `libnm0`,
`wpasupplicant`, `iw`, `rfkill`, `wireless-regdb`, and all dependencies needed
by the selected Debian release. See [Wi-Fi 7 and `nmcli`](wifi.md) for the
installer and post-install commands.
